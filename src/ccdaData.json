            "I discussed with the shin that he has signs and symptoms of trochanteric bursitis in his right hip. Reviewed his x-rays today which do show a well-healed intertrochanteric hip fracture with intramedullary implant in appropriate position. We discussed treatment options for his bursitis including anti-inflammatories, injection as well as physical therapy. I would order him physical therapy as well as Voltaren gel as a topical anti-inflammatory. He can follow back up with me if he is still having significant symptoms in the next 8 to 10 weeks.. All his questions were answered."

            "I discussed with the patient I believe is having pain from bony overgrowth secondary to his fracture healing. At this point he is also having pain and weakness and we are going to order physical therapy for his right leg. I also gave him tramadol to help with his pain. I will see him back in 2 months and if he still having significant pain we will send him to see pain management has I do not think he is a surgical candidate or there is a good surgical option to treat his pain. All his questions were answered."

            "Patient is having pain along his distal IT band. Is mostly occurring with ambulation. His x-rays look great today and his fracture is well-healed. His implant is in appropriate position. I believe most of his pain is coming from IT band syndrome or from his lower back as he is having numbness along the side of the thigh. He can continue diclofenac cream and if his numbness continues to get worse he should see one of our spine specialist. We will follow back up with me as needed. All his questions were answered"
